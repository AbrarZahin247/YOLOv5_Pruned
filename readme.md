## YOLov5 Pruned Model

This repository is developed with inspiration from the [YOLov5 Pruning](https://github.com/AbrarZahin247/YOLOv5_Pruned) repository. It is based on the latest pull from the [Ultralytics YOLov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git) repository.

### Pruning Process

This project implements channel pruning on YOLov5 models using techniques from the research paper ["Learning Efficient Convolutional Networks Through Network Slimming"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Liu_Learning_Efficient_Convolutional_ICCV_2017_paper.html). This method allows for more efficient and lightweight models by slimming down the network while maintaining performance.
